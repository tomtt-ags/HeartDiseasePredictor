This project predicts the presence of heart disease from clinical attributes using the UCI Heart Disease dataset (fetched via kagglehub). We perform exploratory data analysis to inspect missingness, class balance, and featureâ€“target relationships (e.g., age, thalach, chest pain type, sex, fasting blood sugar, resting ECG, exercise-induced angina, slope, and thal), then clean the data by normalizing categorical codes, imputing missing values, dropping non-informative or highly incomplete columns (e.g., id, dataset, ca), and binarizing the target (num > 0). Models are built as reproducible scikit-learn pipelines with a ColumnTransformer (scaling numeric features and one-hot encoding categoricals) and include Logistic Regression and Random Forest baselines tuned with stratified cross-validation. We report accuracy, precision, recall, F1, confusion matrices, and a full classification report, with emphasis on recall for the positive class. Visualizations cover class distribution, key feature distributions by outcome, and a correlation heatmap to flag multicollinearity. The code uses Python 3 with pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn and is intended for educational purposes, not medical advice.
